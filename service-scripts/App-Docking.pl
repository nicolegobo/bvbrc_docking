#
# App wrapper for the diffdock-based docking pipeline.
#
# Docking pipeline requires an invocation of run_local_docking for each PDB file and set of ligands.
#
# The output folder includes a copy of the PDB file used to run the docking, as well as a log
# of the underlying diffdock invocation. Each ligand has an output folder labeled by
# the tag given to the ligand. For the input option where a user-defined list of smiles strings
# is provided, the app will generate ids of the form ligand-XX.
#
# We also generate a report with a tabular summary of the entire run, including links to the
# generated ligand-in-structure PDBs.
